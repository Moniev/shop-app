# Provides a collection of service objects that encapsulate specific business logic

# This module aims to keep controllers thin and models focused on data persistence
# by housing operations that don't fit naturally within a single model's scope
# or represent a cross-cutting concern. Examples include authentication flows,
# payment processing, or external API interactions
module Services
  # Encapsulates diagnostic probes for application readiness and health.
  #
  # This service provides methods to check the operational status of key application
  # components, such as database connectivity and Redis availability. It's designed
  # for use in health check endpoints, providing insights into the application's
  # ability to serve requests.
  class DiagnosticsService
    # Performs a readiness probe for the application.
    #
    # A readiness probe checks if the application is ready to accept traffic.
    # It typically verifies critical dependencies like database connectivity.
    # If the database connection is established, the application is considered ready.
    #
    # @return [Hash] A hash containing the status and a message or errors.
    #   Returns `status: :ok` and a success message if ready.
    #   Returns `status: :service_unavailable` and errors if the check fails.

    end

    # Performs a comprehensive health probe for the application.
    #
    # A health probe checks the overall health of the application and its critical
    # dependencies, including the database and Redis. It provides detailed status
    # for each checked component.
    #
    # @return [Hash] A hash containing the overall status, a message or errors, and component details.
    #   Returns `status: :ok` and a success message with details if all checks pass.
    #   Returns `status: :service_unavailable` with errors and details if any check fails.
